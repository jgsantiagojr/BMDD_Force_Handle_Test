Biomedical Device Design: Force to Handle and Motion Test



This repository includes the software required to collect, record, and process data representing the motion of a walker and pressure applied to its handles from IMUs and pressure sensors applied to a walker. It also includes the data collected from our 18 trials and the graphs produced.
